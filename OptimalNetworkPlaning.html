<h1 class="title">How to protect critical network infrastructure against
sabotage?</h1>
<p class="subtitle">use optimal network planning to build resilient
networks</p>
<!--<p> Wolfgang Spahn(2023-01-31)</p>-->
</header>
<p>Recent events have highlighted the vulnerability of critical
infrastructure by exploiting local points of attack, but with a global
impact. A realistic resilience plan must identify these points of
attack, quickly eliminate them and avoid them in the future. Today’s
‘fibre first, paths and services second’ design approach does not
address this properly. It accumulates vulnerabilities in the late stages
of network deployment as new services compete with those already in
service. Network resilience to sabotage is not optimized. The attack
angles of a potential saboteur with global impact remain hidden.</p>

</figure>
<p>Only by analysing all levels of the network - under all constraints
for a complete build - can you get a true understanding of how to
protect networks against sabotage. This approach has been known for some
time, but has been considered too difficult and complex to put into
practice.</p>
<p>In this article, I show that with today’s hardware and recent
advances in linear programming, end-2-end analysis becomes feasible. It
paves the way for practical end-2-end planning and analysis of optimal
resilient networks that can be applied to existing and newly planned
networks.</p>
<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>In October 2022, the northern part of Deutsche Bahn’s (DB) GSM-R
communications network was completely sabotaged by just two cuts in its
fiber optic cables at two distant locations<span class="citation"
data-cites="wikipediaAnschlagDB">[1]</span>. All trains stopped.
Thousands of passengers were unable to reach their destinations. The
depth of insight into DB’s fiber topology and the simplicity of the
attack raise great concern. It drastically illustrates the importance
and vulnerability of digital communications to critical
infrastructure.</p>
<p>What can be done? The obvious is not possible: Just to increase the
surveillance, isolation and protection of the entire infrastructure
along the 34,000 km of German railroad tracks is far too difficult. A
realistic plan must focus on the most critical elements. This requires a
good understanding of the network’s angles of attack and points of
failure. Only then can additional redundancy and protection measures
achieve the goal of preventing future attackers from disrupting extended
services with so little effort.</p>
<p>In other words, we need to ensure that our network design and changes
to it provide security and robustness in the best and most efficient way
possible.</p>
<p>Today’s design approach is not 100% helpful in this situation, as
current network planning defines optimal paths, but not an optimal
network, which leaves room for improvement.</p>
<p>Why is this a problem? What can be done better?</p>
<h1 id="network-planning">Network Planning</h1>
<p>Communication networks are built on a hierarchical technology stack.
Users or their applications define data transport by specifying
source-to-destination forwarding <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, which is sent along
paths that span multiple fiber links that carry packets from node to
node. Clearly, the attack space is large, diverse, and heavily
influenced by the flow capabilities predefined by the network design. It
is difficult for the operations team to determine, where the fiber
layout has opened up inherent vulnerabilities<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Just to name a few examples where we might suffer:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Fiber redundancy layout may not be robust. Redundant paths (see
sec. <strong>¿sec:sec2?</strong>) run over different fibers, but are
inadvertently bundled in the same cable or duct. Thus, destruction of
one cable or channel segment will also cut the redundant path. Not
good!</p></li>
<li><p>The timing may change too drastically after the redundancy switch
over, so the real-time service cannot handle this change in
characteristics and will not survive the event.</p></li>
<li><p>Congestion may occur after traffic is rerouted, which degrades
the quality of service, which again does not ensure the
service.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To complicate matters, modern networks use a wide range of
technologies. (OTN,Ethernet/RSTP, MPLS-TP, IP, IP/MPLS, TSN, SDN, to
name a few) to build the network topology.</p>
<p>Sure, they all define traffic in very different ways, but they all
ultimately define, over what path and fiber, and with what
characteristics, quality and protection, data will flow through the
network. So the question, “Do we have a proper network design to support
the specification?” remains a constant:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have we chosen the right fiber layout that will give the traffic the
characteristics we want? and does not provide easy angles of
attack?</li>
<li>Does critical data travel through protected paths that are free of
congestion?</li>
<li>Can a path be completely taken over by a well-separated, protecting
equivalent?</li>
</ul>

alt="Figure 1: An example infrastructure: 9 nodes and 18 fiber are available to setup the network." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Figure 1: An example infrastructure: 9
nodes and 18 fiber are available to setup the network.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>To give a practical example to shed light on this challenge please
have a look into figure [fig. 1;]</p>
<p>We just consider a small core segment of 3 nodes 0, 1, 2, which are
connected any to any, and which shall serve 6 access nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
and 8. For connectivity there are 18 fiber links available.</p>
<h1 id="multi-level-constraints">Multi level Constraints</h1>
<p>To reflect real complexity, we consider multiple layers, but with
only a few constraints to keep it digestible<a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>. We
first define rules in English to later translate them into mathematical
formulas.</p>
<h2 id="constraints">Constraints</h2>
<p>Since devices are limited in fiber ports (or SFPs), we have to choose
which fiber can be served.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rule1:</strong> <em>Each node can only support up to 4 SFPs:
so not all fiber links can be served! Choose the best ones!</em></li>
</ul>
<p>We consider an end-to-end communication service that spans multiple
nodes: A real-time critical application where server needs to talk to a
number of clients and vice versa without interruption:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rule2:</strong> <em>Nodes 3,4..8 connect to node 0
redundantly. A protecting path can take over with the least change in
characteristics.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Connecting two nodes in critical situations means relying on a path
from source to destination that is kept alive under all circumstances,
even if some fiber links <a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> stop working. In order to protect
against failure, an alternate path must be able to take over<a
href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rule3:</strong> <em>There is one working and one protected
path. These two pathes are disjunct (don’t share any link or
intermediate node).</em></li>
</ul>
<p>To respect real-time, switch over has to be fast<a href="#fn6"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> and
protecting path needs to mirror working paths’ characteristics as close
as possible.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rule4:</strong> <em>To assure similar timing there should be
not more than 1 hop difference between working and protecting path<a
href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, we have cost as a competing requirement. Together with all
the technical constraints we want to find a global optimum:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Avoid costs of optical fiber connection modules (small formfactor
plugable SFP)</p>
<p><strong>Rule5:</strong> <em>Use as little fiber as possible. Core
node SFPs are more expensive than aggregation SFPs, so avoid SFPs at
[0,1,2].</em></p></li>
<li><p>But if invested, expensive optics must be used:</p>
<p><strong>Rule6:</strong> <em>Core hops are preferred over aggregation
hops. Keep traffic on the inner ring [0,1,2].</em></p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="tradional-network-design">Tradional network design</h1>
<p>In traditional design approaches, you start with an ad hoc fiber
layout that satisfies the physical constraints. It is based on the
assumption that this layout will provide a path routing that meets the
specifications. Let’s see if this is justified.</p>
<h2 id="ad-hoc-fibre-layout-assumptions">Ad hoc fibre layout
assumptions</h2>
<p>With a little experience and intuition, we get three obvious starting
points<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>.</p>
<p>In a first attempt, we work with two rings (see fig. 2;), a core ring
[1,2,3] and an outer access ring [4,5,6,7,8] and connect them with three
joints. In a sense, our design will consist of three rings<a href="#fn9"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Rings are good for redundant design because they naturally provide
two paths to each node. The use of SFPs at the core nodes is optimal. We
only need 3 (see fig. 3;).</p>
<p>On the other hand, the long distance from 0 to 3 - neglecting the
direct path - shows the disadvantage of this layout. Clearly, we will
never get similar characteristics for the working and protecting paths.
This gives us a first heuristic rule: pay attention to the size of your
rings.</p>
<figure>
<img src="figures/fig_sol1.inv.gray.png" id="fig:adhoc1"
style="margin:auto; display: block;"
alt="Figure 2: Adhoc1 - Fibre and node layout with only 3 SFPs needed per core node" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Figure 2: Adhoc1 - Fibre and node layout
with only 3 SFPs needed per core node</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Since ring size is an issue, let’s make the rings smaller, which
gives better length differences. But still for connection (0,3) a delta
between working and protecting path of only 1 is not possible!</p>
<figure>
<img src="figures/fig_sol2.inv.gray.png" id="fig:adhoc2"
style="margin:auto; display: block;"
alt="Figure 3: Adhoc2 - Fibre and node layout with 4 SFP core count(g)" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Figure 3: Adhoc2 - Fibre and node layout
with 4 SFP core count(g)</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>So let’s reduce the ring size even further. We arrive at the design
shown in Figure[fig. 4;]. This should do it. Will it? We will see.</p>
<figure>
<img src="figures/fig_sol3.inv.gray.png" id="fig:adhoc3"
style="margin:auto; display: block;"
alt="Figure 4: Adhoc3 - Another fiber and node layout with 4 SFP core count(b)" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Figure 4: Adhoc3 - Another fiber and node
layout with 4 SFP core count(b)</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2 id="find-the-best-path">Find the best path</h2>
<p>Once the fiber layout is established, network routing protocols,
topology protocols, orchestrators or managers can do their work.</p>
<p>Whatever technology is used, they all look for the best path <a
href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> from source to destination. The
more advanced approaches are aware of protection needs, so they will
optimize working and protecting paths together to ensure that they are
disjunctive.</p>
<p>More ambitious algorithms will even try to optimize link capacities.
They will create new paths along underutilized links to distribute
bandwidth more evenly<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>. This is good for capacity
constraints but creates a natural bias toward increasing complexity.
More and more difficult compromises come later in the build.</p>
<p>In short, we can conclude: Current network planning defines optimal
paths, but not an optimal network.</p>
<!-- Unfortunately, the more we fill the network, the more limitations will appear. -->
<p>Let’s look at our example. When routing our ad hoc option shown in
the figure <span class="math inline">\(\ref{fig:adhoc3}\)</span>, the
paths for connection (0-4) and (0-5) come out fine. Not much of a delta.
They are disjunct and well separated. Good job, router! But for
connection (0-6) we cannot find a protected pair, that satisfies all the
rules, either the difference in hops between the working and protected
paths is too high or they are not separated. Not good!</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">or they are not separated
(b).</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As we have already seen, the other two options are even worse.
Neither can make the difference in hop count equal to or less than
1.</p>
<p>As you can imagine. This can quickly become very frustrating and
complex. Do we need core routers with 6 SFP ports? Or should we just try
a different choice of active fiber? Should we go back to the drawing
board and start over again, or should we invest in more hardware? It’s a
quite an effort and there is no guarantee that it will work this
time.</p>
<p>Is there a better way? Let’s see.</p>
<h1
id="multi-level-optimal-solution-using-linear-programming.">Multi-level
optimal solution using linear programming.</h1>
<p>The industry has known for a long time that current approaches to
network planning do not give us an optimal solution. We would have to
optimize all levels and constraints at the same time. The method of
choice is linear programming, a mathematical optimization scheme, that
is well suited to this task, but has long been considered too difficult
and too machine-intensive.</p>
<p>But times are changing. Methods and algorithms that have been dormant
for many years due to lack of computing power and reluctance to dive
into mathematics, are finally shining<span class="citation"
data-cites="Jablonský2015">[2]</span>. The current success in AI is a
very prominent example.</p>
<p>With today’s laptops, our small problem can be solved in
milliseconds. For realistic networks, such as the German mobile backhaul
and FFTH network, optimal solutions were computed as early as ten years
ago. These models were huge, but could be solved in minutes to hours.
<span class="citation"
data-cites="GroetschelRaackWerner2013">[3]</span></p>
<h2 id="optimal-solution">Optimal Solution</h2>
<p>Transformed into standard form our problem can be solved by, for
example with COIN|OR <span class="citation"
data-cites="coinor">[4]</span>. This gives us the solution for the
network topology shown in fig. 5; and fig. 6;} <a href="#fn12"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Figure 5: Optimal Solution: Fiber layout
and respective metric.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The optimal network is asymmetric and uses 2 more fibers than our ad
hoc trials before. Nonetheless, the resource utilization is well within
the limits.</p>
<p>You can convince yourself that all constraints are fulfilled at all
levels. Paths are disjunct and number of hops differ by at most 1.</p>
<figure>
<img src="figures/fig_optimal_paths.inv.gray.png" id="fig:fig_opt_paths"

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Figure 6: Optimal Solution: All protected
paths fulfill the constrains.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Have you seen this option? If not, don’t worry, the solution is not
symmetric, so it’s difficult to find. In more realistic scenarios we
would have many more parameters and no chance to find the optimum by
hand anyway.</p>
<p>Not only when starting from scratch, but also for already deployed
situations, this method helps. Formulating constraints in hard
mathematical facts gives us an objective view of our status quo and its
deviation from optimal. In my opinion, this is a proper and transparent
way to identify angles of attack and ultimately plan defense.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Recent events have demonstrated the vulnerability of critical
infrastructure. Any realistic protection plan needs to prioritize and
identify low hanging fruit.</p>
<p>I hope I have shown how holistic network planning can help. How we
can avoid easy points of attack. How to increase the robustness of the
network design.</p>
<p>Doing this at all levels and under all constraints -instead of
relying on an ad hoc initial assumption on fiber layout- has been too
difficult in the past. Computational requirements and complexity of the
tools had been too high.</p>
<p>I think that recent advances in usability, algorithms, and computing
power will help to approach this in a new complete way. Currently, there
is no plug-and-play software available. Formulating the model and
defining the mathematical constraints requires a background in network
engineering, requirements management, and mathematical optimization.</p>
<p>If you have experience in this area, have remarks/questions, or would
like to know more about how to do this in larger scale with your network
and team, please contact me. I am always open to interesting discussions
and challenges.</p>

the technology used.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"

<li id="fn3" role="doc-endnote"><p>For real networks there are much more
rules to be considered.<a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back"
role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn4" role="doc-endnote"><p>In a more complete pictures we have
to consider as well the nodes explictly, which we will fail to do in
some of our ad hoc examples. You see it?<a href="#fnref4"
class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn5" role="doc-endnote"><p>We name them working and protecting
paths.<a href="#fnref5" class="footnote-back"

<li id="fn6" role="doc-endnote"><p>That’s the job of the node, the
similarity has to be secured by the network!<a href="#fnref6"
class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn7" role="doc-endnote"><p>When network load is low difference
in hop count determines mainly the real-time behaviour. By applying
different kinds of traffic shaping and priority methods, all protocols
try that high prio traffic sees a nearly empty network, where frames
don’t disturb each other. So the influence of number of hops asymmetry
will stay, and needs to be managed<a href="#fnref7"

symmetry!<a href="#fnref8" class="footnote-back"

<li id="fn9" role="doc-endnote"><p>the nodes 0,3,4,5 and 1 would
represent such a subring. There are two others of the same type.<a

<li id="fn10" role="doc-endnote"><p>You may have trouble imagining that
traffic in Ethernet/RSTP switched networks is routed along routed paths.
Yes, there is no explicit path. We are on a switched network where each
node does MAC-based forwarding. But think about it. Once the RSTP tree
is set up and MAC learning is done, there is only one way to get from
source to destination. That’s equivalent to our path. If a link fails,
the RSTP topology will change to provide an alternate tree, which in
turn provides a new path. This will create what we call a protection
path. Of course, in the context of RSTP, paths are a rather verbose
concept.<a href="#fnref10" class="footnote-back"

<li id="fn11" role="doc-endnote"><p>Since packet traffic varies, this
can only be done statistically.<a href="#fnref11" class="footnote-back"
role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn12" role="doc-endnote"><p>Link (2-3) as drawn red, as we want
and any to any connected core. But it is not needed by any path in our
example.<a href="#fnref12" class="footnote-back"
