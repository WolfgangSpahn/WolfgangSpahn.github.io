<p>Just due to their size and access to resources small and medium sized
campanies (SMCs) have challenges to compete against large international
high tech players. But, as large players suffer from bureaucracy,
isolation, lack of interest, huge interia etc. there are potentials and
opportunities to SMBs to compete.</p>
<h1 id="see-opportunities">See Opportunities</h1>
<p><strong>Adapt Quickly and Seize Opportunities</strong> - With much
leaner decision cycles, SMCs can adapt faster, follow trends and seize
opportunities quickly. By realizing speed, SMCs have the means to
outperform their large competitors.</p>
<p><strong>Leverage your customer intimacy</strong> - SMBs typically
have strong relationships with their customers, allowing them to offer
personalized service that larger companies cannot match. A tailored,
well-designed service offering and software application can help
overcome the problem of scale.</p>
<p><strong>Harvest profitable niches</strong> - Focusing on niche
markets that larger companies may not be interested in can complement
the business proposition. But, because niches are niches, finding ways
to offer products and services with low initial investment is key to
ensuring profitability and return on investment.</p>
<h1 id="and-grab-them">And grab them</h1>
<p><strong>Accelerate and boost efficiency by learning from best in
class</strong> - For a small company using their resources efficient is
even more important than for big ones. Here learning from best in class
is a chance. Especially large high-tech companies are quite transparent
what approaches they utilize. They publish their research results and do
utilize massively open source software, which gives SMBs the chance to
learn from state of art and to start from a much higher grounds.</p>
<p><strong>Be able to collaborate with externals and service
providers</strong> - From time to time SMBs face large opportunities,
where typically they have not the inhouse capacity for. Being able to
utilize external helps to bring home at least some of these, is a must
for enabling growth. As SMBs operate in niches non textbook knowhow
areas, bringing externals quickly up to speed is a real contribution to
SMBs growth potentials.</p>
<p><strong>Learn to use upcoming advances in software and chips
early</strong> - Software patterns are growing smarter, chips are
getting more powerful. As development efficiency is always a top
priority for SMBs. Improvements from recent breakthroughs should be
their friends.</p>
<p><strong>Bring benefit to and get support back from your
suppliers</strong> - When it comes to new ideas, suppliers typically
address large players first. But when their customer show no immediate
interest or even feel threatened by the vendorâ€™s proposal, initiatives
slow down. Paths to growth are cut. Here SMBs can step in as early
adaptor, as they are on the forefront of new trends, providing mutual
benefit for both.</p>
